To run the program simply type:

./run.sh 

- This should compile the code and ask for user input similar to this:

Compiling...
Compilation successful. Running the program...
Please enter a positive number for length of discs: 

- Afterward, simply type in a positive int and it will create a vector<string>
and auto-perform the algorithms to see the results:
- The first algorithm will be Left-To-Right algorithm
- The second algorithm will be LawnMower algorithm
Note: we create 2 seperate vector<string> before performing algorithm to 
ensure that we don't use the same vector twice
